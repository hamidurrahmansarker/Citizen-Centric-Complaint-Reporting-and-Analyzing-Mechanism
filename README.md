# Citizen-Centric-Complaint-Reporting-and-Analyzing-Mechanism
The “Citizen-Centric Complaint Reporting and Analyzing Mechanism” was designed and developed as a part of my major academic project (during the 12th Semester) at the “World University of Bangladesh” (WUB). This project was started in November 2022 and ended in March 2023; later onward the project paper was submitted in April 2023 and was published as a “Journal” in June 2023.

This project aims to develop the “e-Complaint” system, providing citizens with a secure and accessible platform to report complaints related to crime and misconduct. By addressing the challenges of the current complaint system, this project strives to increase police accountability and transparency. While the proposed system has some limitations, recommendations have been made for improvement. Future work involves integrating advanced technologies and expanding the system’s integration with other government systems. Overall, this project has the potential to significantly enhance the complaint filing process and increase police accountability and transparency.
